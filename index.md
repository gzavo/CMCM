# CMCM 2023

## Conference details
**Conference website**: [https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2023/](https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2023/)

The ICCS conferences are ranked as [CORE A](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/). Accepted and presented papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). The best papers will be invited for a special issue of the [Journal of Computational Science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-computational-science).

## Track description

**Organisers**: Gabor Zavodszky (University of Amsterdam); Igor V. Pivkin (USI Lugano)

The computational modelling of cell mechanics plays a pivotal role in the research of numerous biological processes: in the flow and interaction of red blood cells in blood, the extravasation of leukocytes, or the growth and metastasis of tumour cells. 
In order to answer the complex emerging challenges, the researchers need to explore, develop, validate, and apply novel computational models.

The central aim of this track is to bring together the prominent members of the field to discuss ideas, challenges, and state-of-the-art solutions to the key questions at the forefront of cellular mechanics research. These discussions will focus on numerical techniques and on the connection of these techniques to complementary experiments.

### Main topics include (but not limited to):

- Cell growth
- Cytoskeletal network
- Rheology and red blood cells
- Platelet margination
- Cell migration
- Cell mechanosensing
- Viscoelastic behaviour of cells
- Cell extravasation
- Micromanipulation techniques (optical tweezer, atomic force microscopy, micropipettes, etc.)
- von Willebrand Factor mechanics
- Glycocalyx interaction

## Manuscript submission details

During submission, you may select either a _“Full/Short Paper”_ or a _“Abstract Only”_ publication. You can also define your preference for an oral or poster presentation. Please understand that this is only a preference. The presentation type of accepted submissions will ultimately be defined by the Organizing Committee and communicated in the notification email.

While we encourage full paper submissions, the “Abstract Only” option caters to researchers who can only publish in specific journals or work for companies in circumstances such that they cannot publish at all, but still want to present their work and discuss it with their peers at ICCS. In the “Abstract Only” option, a short abstract is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS.

The best papers will be invited for a special issue of the Journal of Computational Science

### Steps to submit

1. **Manuscripts are submitted via EasyChair**. Look for the "Paper submission" link on the conference [website](https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2023/).

2. **Prepare the manuscripts**: Abstract up to _2 pages_, Short Paper up to _7 pages_ and Full Paper up to _14 pages_, written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNCS templates. The templates are available for download in EasyChair on the ICCS 2023 submission page (horizontal menu "Templates").
During submission, you may select either a _“Full/Short Paper”_ or an _“Abstract Only”_ publication. Oral presentation is the default. If you prefer to present a poster, please check the “Poster Presentation” option in the submission page.
**Note**: a short abstract (up to 2 pages) is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS.

3. **Submit your paper** to the ICCS 2023 submission site in EasyChair. Choose the following track when being prompted for "Select a Track": Computational modelling of cellular mechanics
